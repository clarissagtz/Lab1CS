// NEED TO ADD QUOTING CODE 
This is an example of an infinite loop:

```
while (1 != 0){
    //do something 
}
```

My birthday is in Octuber 16:
```
int number = input from user; 
if(number == 16){
    System.out.println("Yes thats the day of my birthday ");
} 
else{
    System.out.println("Nop, thats not the day of my birthday");
}
```
