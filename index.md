> This is my last year at UCSD.

My name is :
```
System.out.println("Clarissa Gutierrez");
```

## Code Fun fact
From the different types of loops that exist, the one I like the most is the for loop.

```
for( int i = 0; i < 100 ; i++ ){
    System.out.println(i);
}
```

This is an example of an infinite loop:

```
while (1 != 0){
    //do something 
}
```

My birthday is in Octuber 16:
```
int number = input from user; 
if(number == 16){
    System.out.println("Yes thats the day of my birthday ");
} 
else{
    System.out.println("Nop, thats not the day of my birthday");
}
```
